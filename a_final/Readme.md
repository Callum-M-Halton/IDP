IMPORTANT NOTES
===============

1. THE CODE UPLOADED TO THE ROBOT IS IN FOLDER "a_final"

2. Throughout this project "start" and "home" are used interchangeably as the start/home box is both where the robot starts from and where it finishes. Using both terms may be confusing but was helpful during development as which term makes sense depends on the code bock it's referred to in.
